# Nova1672-PRODIGY_DS_01
This project explores and visualizes gender-based development metrics using data from `gender_development.csv`. It includes a series of insightful visualizations comparing male and female indicators across countries, such as life expectancy, education, income, and overall gender development index (GDI).

## üß† Project Highlights

This script (`main.py`) performs the following:

- Cleans and prepares gender-related development data.
- Visualizes:
  - Top 10 countries by Gender Development Index (GDI)
  - Life expectancy comparison (Female vs Male)
  - Expected years of education (Female vs Male)
  - Income per capita (Female vs Male) using a scatter plot
  - Distribution of Gender Development Index (GDI) using a histogram
